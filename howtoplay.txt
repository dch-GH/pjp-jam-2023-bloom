You are on a space station and you need to grow plants!
The "Bluepetal" plants produce breathable oxygen. These are your only source of air.
The "Purplepetal" and "Whitepetal" do not produce oxygen!

There is a stock market on the middle display. These are the prices you can buy/sell each plants at market price.
The "Bluepetal" usually doesn't sell for very much, try to maximize farming these as much as possible!

Basic guide:
- Till a crop with the hoe and plant a seed with a seed bag.
- Water it with a watering can. You can buy more water at the shop.
- As the plant grows, it absorbs its water.
- Once a plant is fully grown, it will age. Once fully aged, it will wilt and die. Harvest it and sell it before then!
- Harvesting a crop drops a produce box, pick up the produce box and drop it into the green bin to sell it. Try to sell it when the price is highest!
- Crops need above %50 water or else they'll take damage.
- Every so often the station is struck by a radiation storm, the plants won't survive long in one.
- You can buy and place a radiation shield onto a crop, they are one-time use and will fall apart if the crop dies or is harvested.
- Crops do not regenerate health.
- The stock market refreshes every minute.
